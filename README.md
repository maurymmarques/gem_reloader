# GemReloader

Stop restarting your server after editing local gems!

## Usage

In your `config/environments/development.rb`, add:

```ruby
GemReloader.watch :my_gem
```

Or, if you want to watch **all** local gems:

```ruby
GemReloader.watch_all!
```
    
That's literally it. Tiny but useful.

**Important Note**:

> If your gems are in irregular directories (directories that aren't in your `autoload_paths`), you'll need to add those paths in your `application.rb`. GemReloader will automatically add `vendor/gems` to the autoload_paths for you.

By the way, a gem will be picked up by `::watch_all!` if it has a :path attribute.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'gem_reloader'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install gem_reloader
```

## Changelog

- v0.0.2: Added `"vendor/gems"` to the `config.autoload_paths` so the user doesn't have to.
